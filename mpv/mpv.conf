# to autofit-larger, you can also write your screen resolution, works better
# with fullscreen playback. if you don't know it, check here:
# < http://www.whatismyscreenresolution.com >. one thingto note is:
# svp already does this, so you can disable this line if you use
# svp or disable this feature of svp. i haven't tested which one works better.
#
# set fs line to *yes* if you want to start with mpv's non-native fullscreen.
# others are all easy to understand.

# misc.
#
# save-position-on-quit will save the current playback position on quit.
# when this file is played again later, the player will seek to the old
# playback position on start. works with streaming too.
#
# we use .jpg with screenshots because .png takes to much space. if you want
# to use .png disable the screenshot-jpeg-quality line and set screenshot-format
# to png.
#
# input-media-keys controls whether or not mpv will have control over media
# keys. set it to *yes* if you want to use them with mpv.
#
# cache-default determines how much of the video file will be cached
# while streaming. here it is set to 578.3 mbs. while this seems much, it is
# actually just enough to cache 1080p anime episodes entirely so that you
# could continue watching if you experience network problems.
#
# cache-pause pauses the playback when cache is empty, this is cleaner.
#
# cache-initial determines how long to wait before playback, filling
# the cache. these are all on kbs.
